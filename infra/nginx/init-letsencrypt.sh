# -- Script to manage Let's Encrypt certificates for Nginx
# --
# -- This script performs the following actions:
# -- 1. Checks if a valid certificate already exists for the specified domains.
# -- 2. If no certificate is found, it creates a temporary self-signed certificate
# --    to allow Nginx to start up securely.
# -- 3. It then requests a real certificate from Let's Encrypt in the background.
# --    Once obtained, Nginx is reloaded to use the new certificate.
# -- 4. If a certificate already exists, it simply starts Nginx.
# =================================================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
#
# DOMAINS: A space-separated list of domain names for the certificate.
#          The first domain is the primary domain.
#          Example: "example.com www.example.com"
#
# EMAIL: The email address for Let's Encrypt registration and recovery.
#
# STAGING: Set to 1 to use Let's Encrypt's staging environment for testing.
#          This avoids hitting rate limits on the production servers.
#          Set to 0 for production certificates.
#
# RSA_KEY_SIZE: The size of the RSA key. Default is 4096.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# It is highly recommended to set DOMAINS and EMAIL via environment variables
# in your docker-compose file (e.g., CERTBOT_DOMAINS, CERTBOT_EMAIL)
# instead of hardcoding them here.
# The script will use environment variables if they exist.
